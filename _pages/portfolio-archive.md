Hello, I'm a programmer making game related tools, appliations and game itself.

# Backgrounds 

I graduated from Civil Engineering. When I was at school, there was interesting project leads me to IT engineering field.
The project was to develop my own finite element analysis program to analyze bridge structures.
Using Matlab, I made it with GUI to visualize elements' stress, strees type and displacement.
It was making things real experience.
That was the time I felt good about programming making something alive.
Game is the very field to make things alive. 
So I am here to dive in the field.
