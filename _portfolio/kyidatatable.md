## Introduction

Database or data table is essential part in the game development.
But in Unity3D, there is no functionality to handle simple data sets.
Therefore I decided to develope for such a funcationality.

### Team members & responsibilites

This project was done by myself.

### Development environment

The list of tools was used in development.

- Windows 10
- [Unity (5.6.03f)](https://unity.com)
- Git hosted by [Bitbucket](https://bitbucket.org)

## Requirements

**Easy to use**

Creating and managing data table should be easy and automatic.
GUI should be intuitive so that makes people don't have to read the manual to know how to use this asset.

**Funtionality**

Well integrated to Unity.
Utilizes ScriptableObject.

## Implementation

### Automatic code generation

KYIDataTable automatically generates ScriptableObject script corresponding to data table schema. Dependencies between auto-generated code and data schema will be kept by unity system.

### XML import & export

KYIDataTable allows user to edit data using preffered external tools like Excel. User can import and export XML document to Unity system.
Also it has simple encryption support based on AES algorithm.

### Unity integration

Using ScriptableObject generated by KYIDataTable makes easy to refer a data table in custom script.

### Input helper

Handy tool to quickly manipulates data table in Unity.
